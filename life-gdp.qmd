## Introduction
The Gapminder dataset suggests a strong correlation between a country's GDP per capita and life expectancy. Generally, wealthier nations tend to have higher life expectancies. However, this relationship is not strictly linear, and other factors such as healthcare, education, and inequality influence life expectancy.

## Data Visualization

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)

# Create scatter plot
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_log10() +  # Log scale for better visualization
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs. GDP per Capita",
       x = "GDP per Capita (log scale)",
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
