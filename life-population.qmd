## Introduction
The Gapminder dataset allows us to explore the relationship between life expectancy and population size. While population size does not directly determine life expectancy, countries with larger populations often show diverse health conditions, economic structures, and healthcare systems.

## Data Visualization


```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(gapminder)

# Create scatter plot
ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = pop, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_log10() +  # Log scale for better visualization
  labs(title = "Life Expectancy vs. Population",
       x = "Population (log scale)",
       y = "Life Expectancy (years)") +
  theme_minimal()
```
